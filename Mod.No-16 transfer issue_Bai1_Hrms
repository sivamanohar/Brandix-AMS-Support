issue: Mod.No-16 Transfer issue in Bai_HRMS

Concern:This is brings to your perceive that,
Mod. No- 16 transferred to Section-4  from Section-1, The Module number also got changed as Mod-63
But in HRMS still they are allocated in Section-1,
Hence request you pls change their allocation to Section-4 with revised Mod.no 63.
Pls do check their incentive issue also.

Go to -> Bai1_HRMS
 DB --> bai_hr_database
 Table --> emp_section_reference
 
 Select * from bai_hr_database.emp_section_reference
 
 In this table '0' refers to active mode 
   and '1' refers to inactive mode.
   
   here we have to disable mod.No-16 and enable mod.no-63 and also change section 1 to sec.4.
   
   
   UPDATE bai_hr_database.emp_section_reference SET mod_status='1' WHERE mod_pid='16'
