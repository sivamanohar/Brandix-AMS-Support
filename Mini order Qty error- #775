 Issue : Concern is Mrs.Akula.P  wants data in Mini Order No. 94 but unfortunately data is displaying in Mini Order No.95. 

  Url: In bai3net:8080, Reports -> Bundle wise Performance Reports -> Mini Order Reports.. This path is to trace the path of the particular issue folder.

 We are using  two databases here:

  Database 1: brandix_bts. This db is for internal working purpose.
               We should check through 'ids' according to the schedule Numbers.
  Table 1: 
              tbl_order_master  -> Field Name is 'Product Schedule'
  Based on table 1 id, we shld search in table 2 id
 Table2:
           tbl_min_order_ref -> ref_crt_schedule( Field Name)
same process in table 3

Table 3:
     tbl_miniorder_data -> mini_order_ref(Field Name)
    

    Database 2: brandix_bts_uat . This db is for dashboard purpose.
         In this DB, we are using two tables to solve this issue.
         Table1: view_set_3_snap.
         Table2: view_set_snap_1.. (approx)

       According to the bundle numbers, change mini order number in both databases (tables).
